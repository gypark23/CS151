# CS15100: Introduction to Computer Systems

CS151 introduces a selection of important computer science topics and techniques by way of instruction in computer programming and software development. 

The specific goals of the course are these:
* to understand how to solve computational problems in terms of identify- ing, and, when necessary, designing, relevant abstractions,
* to process data structures in several ways, most importantly to process recursive data structures with structural recursion,
* to learn to recognize and exploit common computational patterns through code organization, code factoring and higher-order programming,
* to learn to use simple and polymorphic types as a powerful approximation of correctness in computer programs, and
* to analyze the efficiency of certain algorithms.

This repository includes Racket files for coding homework.
